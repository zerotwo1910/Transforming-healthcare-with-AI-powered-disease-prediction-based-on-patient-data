## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning solution for early heart disease detection based on clinical parameters. The system employs multiple advanced classification algorithms to predict the presence or absence of heart disease with high accuracy and clinical relevance. Designed with healthcare professionals in mind, the project emphasizes interpretability alongside predictive performance.

## Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods may miss subtle patterns that indicate disease risk.

   - Numerical features: Median imputation
   - Categorical features: Mode imputation

2. **Outlier Detection & Treatment**:
   - IQR method for identification
   - Capping strategy for treatment

3. **Feature Transformation**:
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - StandardScaler for numerical features

4. **Train-Test Split**:
   - 80-20 split with stratification

### Feature Engineering

## Key Insights

- **Primary Predictors**:
  1. ST depression during exercise (oldpeak)
  2. Chest pain type (cp)
  3. Thalassemia (thal)
  4. Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)

- **Clinical Relevance**:
  - Strong correlation between exercise-induced angina and disease presence
  - Males demonstrate higher disease prevalence
