## Overview
This project develops an AI-powered system for predicting heart disease using machine learning classification techniques. By analyzing patient clinical data, the system determines the presence or absence of heart disease, providing a valuable tool for early detection and diagnosis support.

## Problem Statement
Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with many cases going undetected until serious complications arise. Early detection through AI-assisted diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes while reducing healthcare costs through preventive care. This project addresses a binary classification problem in medical diagnostics with significant real-world applications.

## Key Features
- **Multiple ML Models**: Implements and compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network, and Gradient Boosting
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves â‰¥85% prediction accuracy on test data
- **Optimized for Clinical Use**: Prioritizes recall to minimize missed disease cases
- **Interpretable Results**: Provides feature importance analysis and visualization
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes GUI for clinical staff to make predictions

## Dataset
The project uses the Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle, containing 303 patient records with 13 clinical features:
- Demographics: age, sex
- Vital signs: resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels
- ECG results: resting ECG, maximum heart rate
- Exercise test results: exercise-induced angina, ST depression
- And more health indicators

## Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|
| Logistic Regression | 0.82 | 0.83 | 0.80 | 0.81 | 0.87 |
| Random Forest | 0.85 | 0.86 | 0.83 | 0.84 | 0.90 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.87 | 0.88 | 0.85 | 0.86 | 0.92 |
| Neural Network | 0.86 | 0.87 | 0.84 | 0.85 | 0.91 |
